* Bike-sharing: used an artificial neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership. 
* TV-script-generation: generated "fake" Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs, based on part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
* Face-generation: defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces, to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.
